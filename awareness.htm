      <h2 class="title" style="color:white"> Depression</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">
        Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. Also called major depressive disorder or clinical depression, it affects how you feel, think and behave and can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems. You may have trouble doing normal day-to-day activities, and sometimes you may feel as if life isn't worth living.
 
To be diagnosed with depression, the symptoms must be present for at least two weeks. More than just a bout of the blues, depression isn't a weakness and you can't simply "snap out" of it. Depression may require long-term treatment. But don't get discouraged. Most people with depression feel better with medication, psychotherapy or both.

    <h2 class="title" style="color:white">Anxiety</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">
      Experiencing occasional anxiety is a normal part of life. However, people with anxiety disorders frequently have intense, excessive and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations. Often, anxiety disorders involve repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks).
 
      If your feelings of anxiety are extreme, last for at least 6 months, and are interfering with your life, you may have an anxiety disorder.
       
      These feelings of anxiety and panic interfere with daily activities, are difficult to control, are out of proportion to the actual danger and can last a long time. You may avoid places or situations to prevent these feelings. Symptoms may start during childhood or the teen years and continue into adulthood.

    <p class="subtitle">
      Stress can be defined as any type of change that causes physical, emotional or psychological strain. Stress is your body's response to anything that requires attention or action. Everyone experiences stress to some degree. The way you respond to stress, however, makes a big difference to your overall well-being.
 
      One should seek medical attention if there is a feeling of being  overwhelmed, if one is using drugs or alcohol to cope, or if there are thoughts about hurting oneself. The primary care provider can help by offering advice, taking a family doctor’s appointment or referring to a therapist.    </p>
